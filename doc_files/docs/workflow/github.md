#### Introduction

Because the files necessary to EnviroTyping are located in a repository, it will be increasingly helpful over time if you create your own account on [GitHub](https://github.com). This allows you to easily access not only the EnviroTyping dataset available at the time of this writing, but also any changes made over time. The first thing you will need to do is "Fork" the master repository to your own. Doing so is straight-forward.
